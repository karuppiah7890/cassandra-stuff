I was simply checking out Cassandra website to explore and thought I could checkout the Cassandra on K8s thing

More like, C* on K8s. Looks like C* is the short form for Cassandra ;)

The latest update is here

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Cassandra-and-Kubernetes-SIG-Update-2.html

I was reading the older update first then

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Cassandra-and-Kubernetes-SIG-Update-and-Survey.html

I noticed some links

https://operatorframework.io/operator-capabilities/

https://github.com/Anant/awesome-cassandra/blob/main/README.md

https://github.com/Anant/awesome-cassandra/blob/main/README.md#cassandra-deployment

Looks like there have been many community built operators before, around 5 of them being popular. Now they are looking at one operator and maintaining that one operator in Apache Cassandra official project. I think mostly it will be on top of DataStax operator, skimming through the updates. I'm still reading though

Also I was reading the https://operatorframework.io/operator-capabilities/ and it was really cool !

I mean, I haven't read such detailed information on operators. I think I might build an operator for fun and try out some stuff ;) For example, create a Redis operator! ;) And also checkout the Cassandra one and try to contribute to it :D

Oh, wrong link

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/Cassandra+Kubernetes+SIG

That's the correct link

And some specific meetings are under it
