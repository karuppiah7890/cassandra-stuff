# Getting Started

For now I'm just simply getting started with Cassandra. Just reading the website. I'm also learning a bit of Redis. But I was doing too much of it and figured I could do with a slight change of topic and mindset and environment to not get bored with the monotonous thing ;)

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=apache+cassandra&ia=web

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html

I was reading through https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html and it felt pretty cool !

I was downloading the PDF linked in the `Performant` section and Firefox showed me a security warning. Apparently the file is coming from a HTTP URL

I tried the HTTPS URL and that works too. I'm planning to create my first PR for Cassandra - for the Docs :D ;) [TODO]

https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdf link instead of http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdf

---

I just noticed the word `Masterless architecture` in https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html and was wondering what's that supposed to mean. I mean, if there are multiple masters / primaries, that still means there's a concept of master / primary. Does it mean there's no concept of primary AT ALL in Cassandra? Hmm, something to checkout and then think about [TODO]

I noticed the section on Quality

```
Focus on Quality

To ensure reliability and stability, Cassandra is tested on clusters as large as 1,000 nodes and with hundreds of real world use cases and schemas tested with replay, fuzz, property-based, fault-injection, and performance tests.
```

It's cool that they have lot of tests! Of course! I would like to write some tests for Cassandra ;) :D

---

```
Distributed

Cassandra is suitable for applications that canâ€™t afford to lose data, even when an entire data center goes down. There are no single points of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical.
```

Hmm. Every node is identical? ðŸ¤” Something to checkout! [TODO]

---

And oh yeah, Cassandra 4.0 is here it seems! https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Apache-Cassandra-4.0-is-Here.html , something to checkout ! [TODO]

---

When I was checking out where the repo is, I was looking for repo link but couldn't find it on the site. I guess I should have just searched it. But anyways, in the journey I found these -

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/community.html#how-to-contribute

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/community.html

I also found there's a Kubernetes SIG ! https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/Cassandra+Kubernetes+SIG It's perfect ! I think I would love to know how databases, distributed databases and distributed storage systems run on top of Kubernetes and other similar orchestration platforms ! :D

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/community.html#discussions

I also noticed the SIG update here in main page https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html - https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Cassandra-and-Kubernetes-SIG-Update-2.html

and other stuff https://cassandra.apache.org/_/blog/Apache-Cassandra-Changelog-8-June-2021.html

---

Gonna get the code first!

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=cassandra+code&ia=web

https://github.com/apache/cassandra

Finally! Got the mirror at least!

Got the contribution link -

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html

Some good suggestions on contributing -

```
Here are some suggestions for ways to contribute:

- Update the documentation
- Answer questions on the user list
- Review and test a submitted patch
- Investigate and fix a reported bug
- Create unit tests and d-tests

```

I'm wondering what `d-tests` are, haha

I think this list makes so much sense! I mean, I know that investigating and fixing bugs are a great way to contribute and learn about a project. Also recently I have been wondering about reviewing PRs too, on some projects. But yeah, I may not know much to review very deep, but I could read the code, understand it, suggest / ensure basic things like - ensuring tests pass etc

Answering questions and updating docs - it requires quite some knowledge actually !

The link for `patches` on this doc is broken ! this doc https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html

it says https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html#:patches.adoc

The link is under https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html#updating-documentation

Another broken link - https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html#:testing.adoc

and another https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html#:patches.adoc

both under - https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html#create-unit-tests-and-dtests

I think I need to fix the broken links [TODO]. Riase issue and fix it. Right links are - https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/patches.html and below one -

https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/testing.html

And also add a way to get the link to the different sections of the doc, like, to get this link - https://cassandra.apache.org/_/development/index.html#create-unit-tests-and-dtests , I had to do "inspect" on the web page and use the `id` of the header tag and append it to the URL. Hmm. [TODO] Raise issue and fix it

---

I found out what a D Test is. Like I thought. A distributed test ;)

https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest

Found the issue hub for Cassandra !

https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CASSANDRA%20AND%20Complexity%20%3D%20%22Low%20Hanging%20Fruit%22%20and%20status%20!%3D%20resolved

And of course I already have an account in ASF JIRA. I forgot about it. I need to also tag it as ASF and not just Apache JIRA in my password manager

I was checking if my issue is already reported there, hmm

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16838?jql=project%20%3D%20CASSANDRA%20AND%20text%20~%20%22doc%20broken%20link%22

I just saw this

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16838

Some new website stuff -

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16761

Hmm

Created an issue !! :D

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16870

ASF Slack!

https://s.apache.org/slack-invite

https://infra.apache.org/slack.html

https://the-asf.slack.com/

Right, I need to contact someone to get access to the Slack, hmm. I'll just do that sometime, I guess

Join slack by getting an invite [TODO]

Looks like doc is a separate thing

https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/

And when I click on pencil edit button, it takes me to

https://github.com/polandll/cassandra/edit/trunk/doc/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc

And that `modules` directory is not there in my git repo, hmm

and older docs look like this

https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/3.11/index.html

I think site code maybe somewhere else? Hmm

https://github.com/apache?q=cassandra&type=&language=&sort=

Right, there's a separate repo, hmm

https://github.com/apache/cassandra-website

Wow, no results, hmm

Next steps, check about the steps to contribute and about how to build

https://github.com/apache/cassandra-website#development-cycle

https://github.com/apache/cassandra-website#building-prerequisites

And the `src` has a `index.html` that seems to make sense, hmm!
